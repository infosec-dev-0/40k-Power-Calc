# 40k-Power-Calc
A calculator for Points per Wound, Shots per Point, and other 40k math

This project aims to take the excellent unit evaluation article found https://www.goonhammer.com/quantifying-naramyth-a-method-of-unit-evaluation-or-a-love-letter-to-the-skorpius-chassis/ and turn it into a quick calculator for list building.

My first goal of the project is to build a quick interactive script for taking a unit and outputing the Essential Points per Would and Points per shot.  Further goals would be adding a GUI, and a roster input.
